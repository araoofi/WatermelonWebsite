    <p>The ongoing genocide in Gaza has resulted in immense suffering, with countless lives lost and entire communities displaced. For years, the people of Gaza have faced devastating violence, blockades, and widespread human rights violations. As global awareness of this crisis grows, there is a strong desire to take action and support the victims by boycotting companies that fund or contribute to these atrocities.</p>

    <p>Our website was created with one goal in mind: to make it easier for individuals to find and support businesses that align with their ethical values. We provide a comprehensive search tool that allows users to identify companies that do not support or fund the ongoing genocide in Gaza, helping consumers make informed choices and use their spending power to stand against injustice.</p>

    <p>We understand that not every company may be listed, but we are committed to continually researching and updating our database.</p>

    <p>If you’re looking for information on a company that’s not yet included, please use our "Request Info" page to let us know, and we’ll gladly look into it and update the list accordingly.</p>

    <p>By promoting transparency and offering easy access to essential information, we aim to empower individuals to take meaningful steps in supporting those who need it most.</p>
